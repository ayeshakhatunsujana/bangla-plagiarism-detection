Hi all, here is my proposal.

**Modeling Experiment Proposal:** 

Semantic Plagiarism Detection Task using a Bangla Paraphrase

**Reasons for Choosing this Dataset:** 

There are mainly two reasons for selecting this dataset. One is that the dataset contains Bangla sentence pairs labelled as paraphrases or non-paraphrases, which is essential for detecting semantic plagiarism. The second reason, or we can say the motivation behind the choice of this dataset, is that since semantic plagiarism detection is a growing concern, especially with AI-generated content, this dataset provides an ideal test case. 

**How Model will Differ from Existing one:**
Actually, much work has been done in this particular area on high-resource languages like English, but I want to know how low-resource languages like Bangla work using transformers for Semantic Plagiarism Detection Task.  

Dataset from Hugging Face: [https://huggingface.co/datasets/bracealround/BnPC-A-Gold-Standard-Bangla-Paraphrase-Corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bracealround/BnPC-A-Gold-Standard-Bangla-Paraphrase-Corpus) 

**Modeling Approach:** 

 I will be using a hybrid approach combining paraphrase generation and sentence embedding techniques. My pipeline includes paraphrase generation using transformer models like T5, sentence embeddings using Sentence-BERT, and measuring similarity using the F1 score. Iâ€™ll evaluate the model using the above metrics and experiment with different paraphrase models to identify the best approach for detecting semantic plagiarism.
