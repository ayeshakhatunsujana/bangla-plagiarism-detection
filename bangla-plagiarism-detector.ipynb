    "# Abstract\n",
    "Bangla, the seventh most spoken language in the world, remains underrepresented in the development of advanced NLP tools. Plagiarism detection is especially critical in low-resource languages like Bangla, where traditional plagiarism detection tools often fail to detect complex paraphrasing and semantic similarity. To address this, I have proposed a hybrid approach for semantic plagiarism detection in Bangla by combining paraphrase generation and sentence embedding using Large Language Models (LLMs). Models such as BanglaT5, and multilingual versions of BART are employed for paraphrasing. To measure semantic similarity between original and paraphrased texts, I have used Bangla-BERT. Evaluation metrics including F1-score ans BERTScore are used to assess performance. My findings shows that Bangla-T5 performed good than mBART in different threshold. \n",

    "In this project for detecting semantic plagiarism using a hybrid approach. The first part involves paraphrasing, and the second part focuses on sentence embedding. \n",
    "First, I have started with a pair of sentences to check for potential plagiarism. Than, the input sentences transforms the original sentence (S1) into multiple paraphrases (S1_P1, S1_P2, S1_P3, ..., S1_PN) using language models like Bangla-T5 and mBART. \n",
    "Secondly, sentences are turned into vector embeddings using models like Bangla-BERT. I have computed a semantic similarity score between the original and its paraphrase. If this score exceeds a chosen threshold(0.55-0.85), flag it as potential plagiarism. Finally, these similarity scores are used to assess how likely the text contains plagiarized content."

    "The plot shows how well three language models—Bangla-T5, mBART, and GPT-4o-mini—perform in detecting plagiarism in Bangla using F1 Scores at different similarity thresholds. As the threshold gets higher (from 0.55 to 0.85), Bangla-T5’s performance drops sharply, meaning it struggles when stricter matching is required. On the other hand, mBART performs steadily, with only a small drop in its scores. GPT-4o-mini gives the best results across all thresholds, staying strong even at high levels. Overall, GPT-4o-mini is the most reliable for finding paraphrased plagiarism, while Bangla-T5 may need improvement to work well in stricter cases."

    "## Plot 02\n",
    "This plot shows the Bangla-BERT similarity scores for three language models—Bangla-T5, mBART, and GPT-4o-mini—at different thresholds used for Bangla plagiarism detection. The BERT score measures how semantically close the generated paraphrase is to the reference sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the plot, we can see that GPT-4o-mini consistently achieves the highest BERT scores, peaking at 0.95 and staying above 0.92 across all thresholds, which indicates strong semantic understanding. Bangla-T5 also performs well, maintaining a steady BERT score of around 0.86. In contrast, mBART has the lowest scores, remaining flat at 0.75 throughout, suggesting weaker semantic similarity in its paraphrases. Overall, GPT-4o-mini demonstrates the best semantic match quality, while mBART lags behind, and Bangla-T5 performs moderately well."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion one observation I would like to share is that paraphrase generation did not significantly improve the results in this case. As we know, language models often struggle with low-resource languages like Bangla. However, better performance might be achieved by fine-tuning the language model and experimenting with different types of prompting strategies."
